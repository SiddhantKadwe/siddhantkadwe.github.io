Hello everyone, thank you for visiting my webpage!

I am a MSc. RoboSys student at the RWTH Aachen University, Germany and currently also working as a robotics intern at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). I work on Nonlinear optimization of robot trajectories in GPUs.

I completed my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University in 2019. During my undergrad, I have participated in various competitions such as "Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC)", organized by Experimental Sounding Rocket Association and Spaceport America; "Texas Instruments India Innovation Challenge" by you guessed it right! Texas Instruments and Government of India; "Aero Design Challenge" by Society of Automotive Engineers and many more...

I am an avid traveller, likes cooking and a newbie to 10 mins Chess.

If you have any amazing ideas or projects and would like to collaborate, feel free to message me on LinkedIn or via email :)
